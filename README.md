# ASSISTPortfolio
ASSIST assembly design portfolio
This is a series of programs I wrote for my ASSIST assembler class during spring of 2022. They rely on the file structure in Marist's mainframe.
Since much of the output files have unfortunately been lost, I have limited this portfolio to what I believe is the penultimate project of mine, the matrix multiplier. I believe it adequately shows my skills.
